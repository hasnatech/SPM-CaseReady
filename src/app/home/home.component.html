        <p>Case Ready is a full service meat program designed to replace a grocery store's butcher. Case Ready delivers the meat already cut & packaged to the store, 
          so the store employees only have to worry about placing it on the shelf. The service uses data & shopper insights to determine customers' packaging preferences 
          and adapt to trends in both culinary flavors & shopping habits. Cargill also creates shelf-space solutions based on data to recommend assortment, pricing, & promotion 
          opportunities. Case Ready reduces labor costs and shrink loss from products being thrown away/sold at a discount. It also reduces the need for inventory space as the meat 
          is delivered ready to go. Case Ready claims to reduce shrinkage by 35% &  packaging costs by about 75%.</p>

        <p>Case Ready's main "competitor" in this case is the current method of paying a butcher worker approximately $31,000/year, 
          which has a much lower up-front cost than Case Ready, but you have a hunch that the client isn't factoring a lot of costs like labor and lost sales. 
          Your job is to create a unique, creative value proposition by first identifying value drivers then calculating the value of the most important value drivers, 
          and then communicating your value proposition to your prospective client, Green Grocers.</p>

                   <li>Green Grocers is located in an area that makes hiring challenging & they struggle with turnover in the meat department. Meat cutting is done 5 times weekly and takes about 6 hours each time. It also has to be performed by an employee that requires special training</li>
                   <li>The butcher program takes about 10 hours each week for an assistant manager to track inventory and determine what meat needs to be ordered, cut, etc</li>
                   <li>Green Grocers estimates that they could increase sales by .02% if they could predict when products would run out and avoid items running out of stock. A major concern of managers is that they fear they lose sales due to long wait times</li>
                   <li>Shrinkage (theft/spoilage) costs the client about 6% of sales</li>
                   <li>Their current butcher program requires a significant amount of space in the backroom and cooling storage. If they utilized case ready, they could reduce their current packaging budget of $.65/lb</li>
                   <li>While not every cut is being used by Green Grocers, they do make some profits from their trimmings, which comprise about 3.3% of volume purchased & are sold at $.87/lb, on average</li>
